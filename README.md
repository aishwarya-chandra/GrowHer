Women entrepreneurs often struggle to secure funding due to systemic biases and lack of access to investor networks. Despite owning a significant percentage of small businesses, they receive only a small fraction of venture capital funding. Traditional funding avenues, such as bank loans and venture capital firms, tend to favor businesses with established networks, which disproportionately benefits male-led companies. Additionally, small businesses face difficulties in gaining visibility on mainstream professional networking platforms, where larger, well-funded corporations dominate. This lack of visibility makes it harder for women-led startups to connect with investors who align with their vision and industry. Without a dedicated space, women entrepreneurs are left to navigate fragmented support systems, making fundraising and business growth unnecessarily difficult.
